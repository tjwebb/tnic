#summary This article describes the configuration preferences for tnic, and how to set them.

= Adaptive Configuration =

tnic is designed to run on a variety of platforms to accomplish its goal of
developer-friendly modular computation. As such, tnic is able to adapt, at
runtime, to many different hosting environments and persistence layers. 
Currently, tnic supports the following environments "out-of-the-box":
    * The Google App Engine
    * Linux + Tomcat + Java + MySQL
    * (coming soon) Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP
For Java servlet environments such as the App Engine and Tomcat, tnic utilizes
the standard servlet init() method (per the Java Servlet API) to set
common configuration variables during runtime. Some of the settings that are
determined during runtime are:
    * The type of caching to utilize
    * How to start/manage threads
    * How to manage http connections
The system itself determines how to handle the above components during runtime.
In this way, tnic "adaptively" configures itself in many respects, lending
itself to easy portability to and from different systems and platforms. tnic can
also adaptively configure certain persistence layers, such as App Engine + JDO
and PHP + MySQL. Other persistence layers may require manual configuration, 
explained in detail in the "Manual Configuration" section below.

= Manual Configuration =

The primary things you will need to configure for your system manually:
    * Persistence Layer, if not officially supported
    * Load balancing policies
